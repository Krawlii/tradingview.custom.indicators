# Sky and Abyss System

This system is built on price action analysis to assess market bias, offering traders the flexibility to adapt it to their unique strategies and trading preferences. For optimal results, traders are encouraged to apply setups that align with their trading plan and risk management principles.

I named it the **Sky and Abyss System** to reflect the natural highs and lows of market movements. The concept symbolizes the cyclical nature of the market, with the **Sky** representing bullish opportunities and the **Abyss** representing bearish ones. This system allows traders to capitalize on both upward and downward trends, making it versatile for any market condition.

**That said, this system is just a guide**—your personal understanding of the market is still what ultimately decides your success. If you decide to use this system, make sure to **backtest thoroughly** and ensure it fits your style and psychology before going live.

# Psychological Levels Indicator for TradingView

This indicator allows you to pinpoint key levels after completing your top-down analysis. It creates small lines for each level (10 levels above and 10 levels below), giving you the flexibility to annotate them by hand. When you're finished, you can easily hide or remove the indicator.

## Key Concept

This indicator is based on **psychological levels** in trading—round, significant price points that often act as support or resistance. These levels help highlight where price might react, reverse, or consolidate.

The levels are rounded up to the nearest current price based on the instrument:

- **GBP/USD**: 0.005 (e.g., 1.30000, 1.30500, 1.31000)  
- **GBP/JPY**: 0.500 (e.g., 195.000, 195.500, 196.000)  
- **XAU/USD**: 0.005 (e.g., 2600.00, 2605.00, 2610.00)

## Important Notes

This indicator is just a **guide**. Your own understanding of the market is still what ultimately decides your success. If you choose to use this indicator, **make sure to backtest** it thoroughly and ensure it fits your strategy and psychology.
